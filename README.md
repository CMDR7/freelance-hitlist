Freelancer Hit List Dashboard
A high-performance, cyberpunk-themed tactical dashboard for tracking active job boards, AI training portals, and agency uplinks. Designed for freelancers and AI specialists to manage high-quality signal sources in a single, streamlined interface.


📡 Key Features
Tactical System Search: Real-time filtering across company names, roles, tags, and intelligence notes.
Deep Scan Fallback: If a local database match isn't found, the system triggers a "Deep Scan" UI, providing direct encrypted uplinks to external search engines (Google Jobs, Indeed, LinkedIn) using your specific query.
Stateful URL Sharing: Includes a "Share Search" feature that encodes your current filters and search queries into the URL, allowing you to copy and share specific "hit lists" with a single click.

Contact Dev: Integrated communication panel featuring direct links to the developer's Substack, Instagram, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
Dynamic Status Tracking: Categorizes sources by access type:
Direct Access: Open browsing.
Direct Landing: No-login required landing pages.
Login Required: Portal-based registration needed.


🛠️ Technical Implementation
Single File Architecture: Built entirely in a single HTML/CSS/JS file for ultra-fast deployment and portability.
Responsive Tactical UI: Optimized for wide-screen desktop monitoring while remaining fully responsive for mobile field operations.


No-Framework Build: Pure Vanilla JavaScript ensures zero dependencies and high performance.
History API Integration: Uses history.replaceState to keep the browser URL in sync with the dashboard's current filter state.
